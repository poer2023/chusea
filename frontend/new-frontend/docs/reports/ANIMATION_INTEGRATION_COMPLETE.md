## 📦 What Was Delivered

### 1. ✅ tw-animate-css Integration
- **Properly configured** in Tailwind CSS v4.0
- **Custom animation curves** and durations added
- **Performance-optimized** class generation
- **GPU acceleration** enabled by default

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Animation Components Library

#### Core Components Created:
```
src/components/animations/
├── animation-config.ts           # Central configuration system
├── enhanced-animations.tsx       # Advanced animation components  
├── performance-optimized.tsx     # GPU-accelerated components
├── workflow-animations.tsx       # Workflow-specific animations
├── interaction-animations.tsx    # UI interaction animations
├── hooks.ts                     # Animation utility hooks
└── index.ts                     # Unified exports
```

#### Advanced Components:
- **FadeAnimation**: Multi-directional fades with viewport triggering
- **ScaleAnimation**: Scale effects with bounce variants
- **MicroInteraction**: Hover and interaction effects
- **LoadingAnimation**: 5 loading variants (spinner, dots, pulse, skeleton, wave)
- **StaggerContainer**: Performance-optimized staggered animations
- **GPUAccelerated**: Force GPU acceleration wrapper
- **AnimationPerformanceMonitor**: Real-time performance tracking

### 3. ✅ Workflow Animation System

#### Specialized Workflow Components:
- **WorkflowNode**: Status-based animations (pending → running → pass/fail)
- **ConnectionLine**: Animated workflow connections
- **WorkflowProgress**: Step-by-step progress visualization
- **DataLoading**: Data streaming visualizations

#### Status Animation Mapping:
```typescript
pending   → subtle pulse animation
running   → continuous pulse with indicator
pass      → bounce scale with success styling
fail      → shake animation with error styling
cancelled → fade in with muted styling
```

### 4. ✅ Performance Optimization System

#### GPU Acceleration:
- **Automatic GPU layer creation** for all animations
- **Transform-based animations** (avoid layout thrashing)
- **Will-change management** (applied during animation, cleaned up after)
- **Compositing layer optimization**

#### Performance Monitoring:
- **Real-time frame rate tracking** (60fps target, 30fps minimum)
- **Automatic performance scaling** on low-end devices
- **Memory usage monitoring** and cleanup
- **Battery-aware animation reduction**

#### Responsive Optimization:
- **Mobile**: 70% duration, 50% delay, simplified effects
- **Tablet**: 85% duration, 75% delay, medium complexity
- **Desktop**: 100% duration, full effects

### 5. ✅ Accessibility & User Experience

#### Reduced Motion Support:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* All animations automatically disabled or simplified */
}
```

#### Features:
- **Automatic reduced motion detection**
- **High contrast mode support**
- **Focus state preservation**
- **Alternative content for essential animations**
- **Keyboard navigation maintenance**

### 6. ✅ Mobile Optimizations
